## Overview

A relaxed citywalk focused on architecture, cafés, and the atmosphere of the former French Concession. Wukang Road (武康路) is best-known for its row of preserved early-20th-century villas and the wedge-shaped Wukang Mansion.

<!-- truncate -->

- Estimated time: 1–2 hours (longer if you linger in cafés or galleries)
- Best time: morning or late afternoon (soft light, fewer crowds)
- Difficulty: easy; some uneven sidewalks and narrow alleys

## Suggested route

1. Start at the southern end of Wukang Road (near the main intersection of the French Concession) and head north.
2. Pause at Wukang Mansion (the wedge-shaped Normandie-style building) — photo stop.
3. Continue north along Wukang Road, taking the side lanes to see smaller villas, hidden courtyards and boutique shops.
4. Turn east/west into adjoining streets (tree-lined lanes, small galleries and cafés).
5. Finish with coffee or tea at a neighborhood café and a short walk through Fuxing Park if you want more green space.

(Adjust the start/end points based on where you are staying — the street is compact and walkable.)

## Highlights to watch for

- Wukang Mansion (iconic architecture and good photo angles)
- Early-20th-century villas and gated courtyards
- Independent cafés, bakeries and small galleries
- Street-level details: cast-iron gates, carved wood doors, tiled stoops

## Practical tips

- Wear comfortable shoes; sidewalks can be narrow or uneven.
- Photography: respectful of private residences; many facades are best photographed from the street.
- Accessibility: main route is walkable but not fully step-free in all spots.
- Cash/cards: many small cafés accept mobile pay or cards, but small vendors may be cash-preferred.
- Weather: shade from plane trees helps on hot days; some cafés have outdoor seating.

## Food & drink

- Numerous cafés for specialty coffee and light pastries.
- Small bistros and bakeries — ideal for a light lunch or snack.
- Explore side streets for quieter spots.

## Quick map & transport

- Search maps for "Wukang Road, Shanghai" or "武康路" to get walking directions from your current location.
- Nearby metro/stations depend on your starting point — combine a short metro ride with a walk.

## Notes

This is a flexible, neighborhood-focused walk aimed at soaking in architecture and local life rather than covering major tourist attractions. Adjust pace and route to preference.
